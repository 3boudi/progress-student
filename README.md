# Student Result Checker

## Description
This project is a simple PHP-based web application designed for students to enter their information and check whether they have passed or failed. It includes a database configuration file, a main page for input, and a stylesheet for styling.

## How It Works
1. The student enters their details (e.g., student ID or name) in the form on `index.php`.
2. The program connects to the database via `db.php` to fetch the student's grades.
3. The system checks the retrieved grades against the passing criteria.
4. If the student's grades meet the requirement, a "Pass" message is displayed; otherwise, a "Fail" message appears.
5. The output is styled using `style.css` for a user-friendly experience.

## Installation
1. Clone or download the project.
2. Place the project files in your local web server directory (e.g., `htdocs` for XAMPP).
3. Set up a MySQL database and import the necessary table for student records.
4. Ensure `db.php` contains the correct database connection details.
